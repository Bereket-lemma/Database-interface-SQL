Database Interface Application

This project is a database interface application that allows users to perform Add/Delete and update operations that are reflected in a MySQL database. The purpose of the application is to enable easy editing of data provided by our client, who gave us multiple spreadsheets to upload into the database.

The project was a collaborative effort involving four partners. My primary responsibilities were writing server-side code, creating endpoints, implementing data filtering options, and developing the sorting functionality. I also provided assistance with the frontend, working alongside my teammates to ensure a cohesive and visually appealing design.

*Technologies Used:*

The following programming languages and tools were used in the development of this application:

React.Js

HTML

Express.js

CSS

MySQL

How to Use

To use this application, users can simply navigate to the URL where the application is hosted. From there, they can perform Add/Delete and update operations on the data in the MySQL database. The application also features data filtering and sorting options, which can be accessed through the user interface.
